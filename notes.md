MAJOR REFACTOR LONG TERM:
-Films with opening crawl from swapi
-all Star Wars info is NOT actually typed by users,
    -rather they enter search keywork (Obi wan, Corellia, Falcon, etc)
    -in the appropriate tab for the thing being created
    -then that is sent to SWAPI which is then found or created by in our backend
    -then forever saved in our db
-on edit people can add descriptions/bios of characters
